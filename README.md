# Control Strategy development

All formulas, diagrams are self-developed, if not, the source is listed.

The different versions of control strategies can be found in Control-versions, python test code can be found in Control-tests-python. Note that this code is completely deprecated, since this only served to test out the foundational versions of the control strategies for the sole purpose of having a reference point for the tests in the Golang library. Up-to-date control strategies can be found in flow-engine.
